Change your passwords regularly and use strong alphanumeric passwords which are difficult to crack. Refrain from using too complicated passwords that you would tend to forget. Do not use the same password twice.\\n2. Update both your operating system and applications regularly. This is a primary prevention method for any cyber attack. This will remove vulnerabilities that hackers tend to exploit. Use trusted and legitimate Anti-virus protection software.\\n3. Use a firewall and other network security tools such as Intrusion prevention systems, Access control, Application security, etc.\\n4. Avoid opening emails from unknown senders. Scrutinize the emails you receive for loopholes and significant errors.\\n5. Make use of a VPN. This makes sure that it encrypts the traffic between the VPN server and your device.\\n6. Regularly back up your data. According to many security professionals, it is ideal to have three copies of your data on two different media types and another copy in an off-site location (cloud storage). Hence, even in the course of a cyber attack, you can erase your system's data and restore it with a recently performed backup."]
